The LibE-rary project our team is working on is an application for assisting a more convenient way for controlling the transactions in a library.
The program provides the basic set of features to add/update books, student details and manage the check in specifications for the systems based on the student's
statement of need.Throughout the project the focus has been on presenting the information in an easy and intelligible manner for the students as well as the librarian
to reduce the human effort and time.The current Library Management System does not eliminate the process of searching books within the library campus. Students have
to find books manually. They have to wait until they are not provided with their library card and token. For receiving book they have to show their library card and
wait in line for their turns. The admin personal also have to look manually on which day which person will take the charge within library to manage the overall work.
A college library management is a project that manages and stores books information electronically according to students needs. The system helps both students and 
library manager to keep a constant track of all the books available in the library.It allows both the admin and the student to search for the desired book. 
It becomes necessary for colleges to keep a continuous check on the books issued and returned and even calculate fine. This task if carried out manually will be tedious
and includes chances of mistakes. 
Thus this system reduces manual work to a great extent allows smooth flow of library activities by removing chances of errors in the details.It has also a facility of
admin login through which the admin can monitor the whole system.It also has a facility where students after logging in their accounts can see list of books issued and
its issue date and return date and also the students can request the librarian to add new books.Errors are avoided by allowing the system to keep track of information
such as issue date, last date to return the book and even fine information and thus there is no need to keep manual track of this information which thereby avoids
chances of mistakes.This project is a library management software system with all the basic as well as some innovative features for managing a library. It consists of
a large database of various books available in the library. It also lists various books issued to respective readers.
The system keeps track of all the books readily available and also the books that have been issued to various readers for the time period for which the books have been
issued.The system also handles books database. Readers usually tend to forget the date to return their library books, so this system even calculates fine depending on the expiry date.
Thus this innovative library management system provides enhanced library functionality for this modern world.

The developed program is very user-friendly and capable of performing different job point nad selecting.
The entire project is menu driven for the case of reference.

The system excludes the use of paper work by managing all the book information electronically.
Admin can keep updating the system by providing the new books arrival in system and their availability thus students need not to go to library for issuing purpose.
The system has books well organized and systematically arranged in different categories in the system so that user can easily search and find the book.
